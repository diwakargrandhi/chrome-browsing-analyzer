# Chrome Browsing Analyzer
This repository contains a chrome browsing analyzer extension.

It is a simple offline application which helps you understand your browsing habits. The reason behind coming up with this was that the author wanted to understand where he was slacking off and wanted to know the top websites taking up his time. He was inclined to just get the top ones and not all the info because, greater the information present, greater the time it will take to process and get useful information.

You can find out which website was browsed for the longest time and you can also find out how much time was being spent on your top websites in the last few days. You can only see the data of the top 7 websites in the three categories, today, in the last 7 days and in the last 30 days.
